This addon sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header of all resources to `*`.

# Installation

`ember install ember-cli-cors`

# Thanks

This repository is a fork of diploidgenomics/ember-cli-cors.
Forking seemed necessary due to the lack of activity in the origina repo.
The addon started to throw warnings and needed a fresh boot.

As we couldn't contact the owners, we took the initiative to fork, update
and maintain under the name `ember-cli-cors2`, which happened
to be available on the npm registry.

We'd like to thank diploidGenomics for initiating the project and
user @Krzyrok for prividing the initial PR to update the project.
